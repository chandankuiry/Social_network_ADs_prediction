## Social network ads prediction

In this project We try to predict if user click on the ads ,then user will buy the product or not.

For this project I used non linear SVM kernel model and Random_forest classifier. and also I used K-fold cross validation and Grid search for model evaluation.

Coding framework I used python, Scikit learn,pandas,matplotlib,numpy.

There are four file Random_forest_model.ipynb and random_forest_classification.py  are same .SVM_kernel_model.py and SVM_kernel_model.ipynb are same .
